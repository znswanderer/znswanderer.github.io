In this blog I will write about physics and programming. So, it would be helpful,
if we can display code and math formulas in a nice way. Let's test this!

We can show code snippets:

{% highlight haskell %}
class OBJC a where
    fromId :: Id -> IOOBJC a
    toId   :: a  -> IOOBJC Id
{% endhighlight %}

And math:

$$
\langle A \rangle = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_n A_n \, e^{-\beta E_n}
$$

Very nice!
