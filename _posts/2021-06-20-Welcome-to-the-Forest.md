This is the beginning of a journey through the forest made from numbers.

[Numbers][math_wigner] seem to be the basis of reality, almost as if reality would consist only of mathematical objects and their relationships among each other. But as the saying goes: often you can't see the forest for the trees! In the same way, it is easy to get lost in mathematics.

In this blog I try to present physical relations as simple and clear as possible. 
Mainly for myself, but I would be very happy, if you find this blog helpful too. 
A focus should be on numerical representation, i.e. physics should be done mainly with the computer. Be it by using mathematical software like [SciPy][scipy] or by computer simulations of physical relations.

Sometimes I will certainly stray into other topics and linger at vantage points that do not necessarily have anything to do with physics. But that is part of a hike.

Surely I will make missteps or get lost in the woods and then I will be grateful if I get a helping hand. Therefore I am pleased about comments to my articles.
